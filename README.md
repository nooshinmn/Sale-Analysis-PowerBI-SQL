# Project Title
Analyzing Internet Sales reporting to Sales Manager

# Description
The purpose of the data analyst project was to create an executive sales report for sales managers, as requested by the business. To ensure that the project met the necessary requirements and standards, user stories were defined and followed throughout the project's delivery.
# Business Requests
We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products to which clients and how it has been over time.
Seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.
We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance and we usually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.

# Getting Started
## Data
In order to meet the requirements set out in the user stories and carry out the necessary analysis, the following tables were extracted through SQL to create the appropriate data model. A single data source, which was in Excel format and contained sales budgets, was also incorporated into the data model at a later stage of the process.
